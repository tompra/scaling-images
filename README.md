## Description

Developed a simple innovative image browsing application using React, TypeScript, React Query, Axios and SASS. User can explire a collection of images by entering a query. The application ensures a browsing experience by rendering images dynamically, allowing user to dive into their visual discoveries.

Utilizing the search functionalty, users can easily find images related to specific keywords or topics. Simply inputting a word returns relevant images, while also offering he option to toggle betwen dark and light themes for personalized viewing preferences.

The application's responsive design ensures a consistent and optimized user experience across various devices, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile device. Built-in pagination facilitates naviation through search results, dynamically loading additional images for exploration.

User can interact with images by hovering over them, capturing favorite images using the built-in favoriting feature powered by the Local Storage API. Additionally, users can dive deeper into the details of each image, immersing themselve in a rich visual experience.

## How to get the project running

### Git clone

1. Create a directory on your local computer: `mkdir <name_your_directory>`
2. Clone the GitHub repository using the command: `git clone <repository-url>`
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd <project-directory>`
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Create your own API_KEY from the <a href="https://unplash.com/developers">Unplash API</a>.
6. After successfully creating your API_KEY, in the root of the project directory, create a `.env` file.
8. Inside this file, copy this: ``VITE_ACCESS_KEY= PASTE-YOUR-API-KEY ``
9. Run the project: `npm run dev`

## Insight

Throughout the creation of the appplication, I've have dive into React Query, Axios, TypeScript, and SASS. By honing my skills in asynchronous data fetching, state managment, and advanced styling techniques, I've gained valuable insights into building efficient and responsive web applications.

Levaraging the power of external APIs and enhancing user experience throught intuitive desing and interactivity has been a key focus, allowing me to create a browsing experience for users exploring the world of visual content.
